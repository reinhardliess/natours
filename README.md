# Natours â€“ A Website For a Fictional Company Offering Nature Tours

## Description

In this project, while following along with the excellent _Advanced CSS and Sass_ [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/), I built a landing page for a fictional startup company called "Natours", a company offering guided nature tours.

A live version can be accessed [here](https://rliess-natours.netlify.app/).
